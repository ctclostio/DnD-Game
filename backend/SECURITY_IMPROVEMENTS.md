# Security Improvements for D&D Game Backend

## Overview
This document outlines security improvements implemented and recommended for the D&D Game backend to address potential vulnerabilities identified by security scanning tools like Gosec.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generation
- **Location**: `/internal/auth/csrf.go`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: CSRF token generation uses `crypto/rand` instead of `math/rand` for cryptographically secure random values.

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: All database queries use parameterized queries with placeholders (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) instead of string concatenation.
- **Example**: 
  ```go
  query := `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1`
  db.QueryContext(ctx, query, userID)
  ```

### 3. JWT Token Security
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: 
  - JWT secrets are loaded from environment variables, not hardcoded
  - Minimum secret length of 32 characters enforced in configuration validation
  - Token expiration times are configurable

### 4. Password Hashing
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Uses bcrypt for password hashing with configurable cost factor (default: 10)

### 5. CORS Configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: CORS is properly configured with specific allowed origins based on environment

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### 1. Input Validation
- Implement comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints
- Use the existing validation package consistently across all handlers
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks

### 2. Rate Limiting
- The rate limiting middleware is implemented but should be applied to all sensitive endpoints
- Consider implementing different rate limits for different operations

### 3. Security Headers
- Add security headers middleware for:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Strict-Transport-Security (for HTTPS)

### 4. Audit Logging
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for:
  - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Authorization failures
  - Data modifications
  - Administrative actions

### 5. Dependency Scanning
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `go mod audit` or Snyk for dependency scanning

### 6. Environment Variables
- Ensure all sensitive configuration is loaded from environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
- Use a secrets management service in production

### 7. Database Security
- Use least-privilege database users
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Implement database query timeouts

### 8. Error Handling
- Avoid exposing internal error details to clients
- Log detailed errors server-side while returning generic messages to users

## Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `gosec` security scanner: `gosec -fmt json -out results.json ./...`
- [ ] Run dependency vulnerability scan: `go list -json -deps ./... | nancy sleuth`
- [ ] Perform OWASP Top 10 assessment
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing before production deployment
- [ ] Review and update this document quarterly

## Acceptable Uses of math/rand

The following uses of `math/rand` are acceptable as they don't require cryptographic security:
- Dice rolling in game mechanics (`/pkg/dice/roller.go`)
- Random selection of non-sensitive game content
- Procedural generation of game world elements
