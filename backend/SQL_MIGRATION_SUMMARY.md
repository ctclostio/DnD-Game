- **BACKEND_TEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Test improvement roadmap
- **GitHub Issue Template** - Standardized SQL migration issue format
- **Updated CI_CD_PROGRESS.md** - Current status and achievements

### 3. GitHub Issues Created ✅

#### SQL Migration Issues (11 total)
- **Large Repositories** (35 queries each):
  - Issue #20: dm_assistant_repository
  - Issue #21: emergent_world_repository
  - Issue #22: world_building_repository

- **Medium Repositories** (15-25 queries):

## Current Status

### Metrics
- **Total Queries**: ~340 across all repositories
- **Queries Migrated**: ~50 (critical repositories)
- **Queries Remaining**: ~290 (11 repositories)
- **Skipped Tests**: 20 files
- **Test Coverage**: ~84% (services), lower overall due to skipped tests

### CI/CD Status
- ✅ Pipeline is passing with critical fixes
- ✅ Tests run successfully with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- ⚠️ Full compatibility pending completion of migration

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Start with small repositories (7-12 queries) for quick wins
2. Begin restoring high-value test files (combat, game session)
3. Monitor CI/CD for any regression

### Short Term (2 Weeks)
1. Complete all SQL migrations
2. Restore all skipped tests
3. Achieve full CI/CD compatibility

### Follow-up Tasks
1. Performance benchmarking
2. Documentation updates
3. Team knowledge sharing

## Helper Resources

### Migration Script
```bash
cd backend
./fix_sql_placeholders.sh
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test specific repository
go test ./internal/database -run TestRepositoryName

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Check coverage
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Quick Reference
- Replace `$1, $2` with `?` placeholders
- Use `QueryRowContextRebind` instead of `QueryRowContext`
- Update test expectations to use `\?` instead of `\$1`
