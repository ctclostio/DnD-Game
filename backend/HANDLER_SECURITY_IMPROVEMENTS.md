# Handler Security Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the security improvements implemented for game session handlers to ensure proper authorization, validation, and access control.

**Implementation Date**: January 11, 2025

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Session Model Enhancements
- **MaxPlayers**: Limit session capacity (default: 6, max: 10)
- **IsPublic**: Control session visibility
- **RequiresInvite**: Private sessions require invitations
- **AllowedCharacterLevel**: Optional character level restrictions

### 2. Join Session Security Checks
1. **Session Validation**
   - Session must exist
   - Session must be active
   - Session cannot be completed

2. **Duplicate Join Prevention**
   - Users cannot join sessions they're already in

3. **Capacity Enforcement**
   - Sessions cannot exceed MaxPlayers limit
   - DM doesn't count toward player limit

4. **Character Ownership Validation**
   - Users can only join with characters they own
   - Character level must meet session requirements

5. **Private Session Protection**
   - Private sessions require invites (future implementation)

### 3. Session Management Security
1. **Create Session**
   - Default to private sessions requiring invites
   - Automatic status and security defaults
   - Capacity validation (2-10 players)

2. **Update Session**
   - Only DM can update session
   - DMID cannot be changed
   - Session existence validation

3. **Leave Session**
   - DM cannot leave their own session
   - Session existence validation

4. **Kick Player**
   - Only DM can kick players
   - DM cannot kick themselves
   - Player must be in session

### 4. Access Control Patterns
1. **Role-Based Access**
   - DM-only operations: Create, Update, Kick
   - Player operations: Join, Leave, View

2. **Context-Based Authorization**
   - GetGameSession: Must be DM or participant
   - GetSessionPlayers: Must be participant
   - GetActiveSessions: Shows only user's sessions

### 5. Handler Implementations

#### GetActiveSessions
- Returns only sessions where user is a participant
- Filters out inactive and completed sessions
- Prevents information leakage about other users' sessions

#### GetSessionPlayers
- Validates user is in the session before showing participants
- Returns full participant list with character info
- Useful for party management

#### KickPlayer
- DM-only operation with full validation
- Prevents self-kick and non-participant kicks
- Proper error messages for different failure cases

## Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Invite System**: Not yet implemented
   - TODO: Add invite generation and validation
   - TODO: Add invite expiration

2. **Session Codes**: Not checking uniqueness
   - TODO: Ensure generated codes are unique in database

3. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented at service level
   - TODO: Add rate limiting for join/leave operations

### Best Practices Implemented
1. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Private sessions by default
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated before processing
3. **Authorization Checks**: Every operation checks permissions
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Distinct errors for different failures
5. **Audit Trail**: All operations can be logged with context

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Test Cases
1. **Authorization Tests**
   - Non-participants cannot view session details
   - Non-DMs cannot perform DM operations
   - Players cannot modify other players' data

2. **Validation Tests**
   - Invalid session IDs are rejected
   - Capacity limits are enforced
   - Character ownership is verified

3. **State Tests**
   - Cannot join completed sessions
   - Cannot perform actions on inactive sessions
   - Proper cleanup when players leave

### Integration Test Coverage
- Test all security scenarios
- Verify error messages are appropriate
- Ensure no information leakage
- Test concurrent operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Invite System**
   - Generate unique invite codes
   - Email/link-based invitations
   - Expiration and single-use invites

2. **Advanced Permissions**
   - Co-DM support
   - Spectator mode
   - Role-based permissions within session

3. **Session Security Features**
   - Password-protected sessions
   - Whitelist/blacklist players
   - Session templates with preset security

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all session modifications
   - Track join/leave events
   - Security event monitoring

## Migration Notes

### Database Changes Required
```sql
ALTER TABLE game_sessions 
ADD COLUMN max_players INT DEFAULT 6,
ADD COLUMN is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN requires_invite BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
ADD COLUMN allowed_character_level INT DEFAULT 0;
```

### API Changes
- Join session now validates character ownership
- New endpoints for active sessions and player lists
- Kick player endpoint for DM management

### Client Updates Needed
- Handle new error cases
- Show session capacity in UI
- Add kick player UI for DMs
- Display session security settings
