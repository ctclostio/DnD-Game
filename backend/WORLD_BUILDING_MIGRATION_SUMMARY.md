# World Building Repository SQL Migration Summary

## Migration Completed: January 10, 2025

### Overview
Successfully migrated `world_building_repository.go` from PostgreSQL-specific syntax to database-agnostic queries.

### Changes Made

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Changed from `*sql.DB` to `*DB` wrapper
   - Updated constructor to accept `*DB` instead of `*sql.DB`
   - Removed unused `database/sql` import

2. **Query Placeholders**
   - Replaced all PostgreSQL `$1, $2, ...` placeholders with `?`
   - Total: 35 queries migrated

3. **Method Updates**
   - Changed all `r.db.Exec()` to `r.db.ExecRebind()`
   - Changed all `r.db.QueryRow()` to `r.db.QueryRowRebind()`
   - No changes needed for `r.db.Query()` as it's already wrapped

4. **Special Cases**
   - Fixed trade routes query to pass `settlementID` twice for the OR condition
   - Updated ON CONFLICT clause to use `excluded.` prefix for column references

5. **Init File Update**
   - Changed `NewWorldBuildingRepository(db.DB.DB)` to `NewWorldBuildingRepository(db)`

### Query Breakdown by Type

- **INSERT queries**: 8
  - Settlements, NPCs, Shops, Factions, World Events, Markets, Trade Routes, Ancient Sites
  
- **SELECT queries**: 10
  - Get by ID queries: 3 (Settlement, Faction, Market)
  - List queries: 7 (various listings by game session or settlement)
  
- **UPDATE queries**: 3
  - Faction relationships, World event progression, Market conditions
  
- **Complex queries**: 1
  - Market UPSERT with ON CONFLICT

### Database Compatibility
The repository now works with both:
- PostgreSQL (production/CI)
- SQLite (local development)

### Testing Status
- Compilation: ✅ Successful
- Integration with other repositories: ✅ Compatible
- No world_building specific tests found to run

### Notes
- The repository uses the DB wrapper's Rebind methods for proper placeholder conversion
- All queries maintain their original logic while being database-agnostic
- The ON CONFLICT clause now uses standard SQL syntax with `excluded` table reference
