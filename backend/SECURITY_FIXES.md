# Security Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (G304) - FIXED ‚úÖ
Fixed in `character_builder.go`:
- Added `validateFileName()` function to sanitize input
- Prevents directory traversal attacks via `..` or `/` in filenames
- Only allows alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores

### 2. Weak Random Number Generation (G404) - CONFIGURED ‚öôÔ∏è
- Created `.gosec.yaml` configuration to exclude game mechanics files
- Game mechanics (dice rolls, world events) don't need cryptographic randomness
- For security-sensitive operations (tokens, passwords), use `crypto/rand`

### 3. Unchecked Errors (G104) - TODO üìã
286 instances of unchecked errors need review:
- Most are in test files (acceptable)
- Some in deferred Close() calls (should log)
- Some in Write operations (should return error)

## Security Configuration

### .gosec.yaml
- Excludes game mechanics from weak random checks
- Sets confidence/severity to medium
- Configured for JSON output for CI/CD integration

### Best Practices Added
1. Input validation for file operations
2. Security documentation for dice roller
3. Clear separation between game randomness and security randomness

## Next Steps
1. Review and fix high-priority G104 errors
2. Add error logging for deferred operations
3. Run security scan in CI/CD pipeline
4. Consider adding security headers middleware

## Running Security Scan
```bash
# Full scan
gosec ./...

# With configuration
gosec -conf .gosec.yaml ./...

# Specific severity
gosec -severity high ./...

# Output to file
gosec -fmt json -out results.json ./...
```
