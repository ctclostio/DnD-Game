# Structured Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have implemented a comprehensive structured logging system using zerolog that provides consistent, searchable, and context-rich logging throughout the D&D Game backend.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logger Package (`pkg/logger/`)

#### Core Components
- **logger.go**: Existing zerolog-based logger (already present)
- **logger_enhanced.go**: New enhanced logger with additional features

#### Key Features
- Context-aware logging with automatic extraction of:
  - Request ID
  - Correlation ID
  - User ID
  - Session ID
  - Character ID
- Specialized logging methods for:
  - HTTP requests with duration and status
  - Database queries with truncation
  - AI operations with tokens and providers
  - WebSocket events
  - Game events
- Configurable output (stdout, stderr, file)
- Pretty printing for development
- Log sampling for high-volume debug logs
- Caller information and stack traces

### 2. Updated Main Application (`cmd/server/main_v2.go`)

#### Key Changes
- Logger initialization at startup
- Structured logging throughout the application lifecycle
- Context propagation for all services
- Graceful shutdown logging
- Environment-based configuration

### 3. Enhanced Middleware (`internal/middleware/`)

#### Logging Middleware (`logging_v2.go`)
- HTTP request/response logging with:
  - Request ID generation and propagation
  - Correlation ID tracking
  - Duration measurement
  - Status code-based log levels
  - Client IP extraction (supports proxies)
  - Query parameter sanitization
- Request context enrichment
- WebSocket upgrade support
- Database query logging helpers

### 4. WebSocket Handler with Logging (`internal/websocket/handler_v2.go`)

#### Features
- Structured logging for all WebSocket events
- Client tracking with unique IDs
- Authentication flow logging
- Message type logging
- Connection lifecycle tracking
- Error categorization

### 5. Handler Structure Update (`internal/handlers/`)

#### Handler V2 Pattern
- All handlers now include logger instance
- Service-specific logging context
- Consistent error logging before responses

## Logging Patterns

### HTTP Request Logging
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "time": "2024-01-06T15:04:05.123Z",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/characters/123",
  "status": 200,
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "bytes_sent": 1234,
  "remote_ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "message": "HTTP request completed successfully"
}
```

### Error Logging with Context
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "time": "2024-01-06T15:04:05.123Z",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "service": "character",
  "method": "GetCharacterByID",
  "error": "character not found",
  "character_id": "char_456",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve character"
}
```

### WebSocket Event Logging
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "time": "2024-01-06T15:04:05.123Z",
  "client_id": "ws_123",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "room": "game_session_456",
  "event_type": "join_room",
  "message": "Client joined room"
}
```

## Migration Status

### Completed
- Logger package enhancement
- Main application with structured logging
- Middleware updates
- WebSocket handler rewrite
- Handler structure preparation

### Still Using Old Logging (To Be Migrated)
- Services using `fmt.Printf`:
  - `dm_assistant.go`
  - `economic_simulator.go`
  - `faction_system.go`
  - `world_event_engine.go`
- Services using `log.Printf`:
  - `ai_battle_map_generator.go`
  - `ai_campaign_manager.go`
- Database layer (needs query logging)
- All handlers (need error logging)

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Readable Logs**: Pretty printing in development
- **Context Tracking**: Automatic request/user/session tracking
- **Debugging**: Caller info and stack traces
- **Filtering**: Structured fields for easy grep/search

### For Production
- **Performance**: Efficient JSON logging
- **Searchability**: All fields are indexed
- **Correlation**: Request tracking across services
- **Monitoring**: Easy integration with log aggregators

### For Operations
- **Alerting**: Structured errors for monitoring
- **Metrics**: Duration and status tracking
- **Security**: Sensitive data sanitization
- **Compliance**: User action tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set log level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `LOG_PRETTY`: Enable pretty printing (true/false)
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Set environment (development, staging, production)

### Log Levels
- **Debug**: Detailed information for debugging
- **Info**: General informational messages
- **Warn**: Warning messages for potential issues
- **Error**: Error messages for failures
- **Fatal**: Fatal errors that cause shutdown

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Context
```go
log := logger.GetLogger().WithContext(ctx)
log.Info().Msg("Operation completed")
```

### 2. Add Relevant Fields
```go
log.Info().
    Str("character_id", characterID).
    Int("level", newLevel).
    Msg("Character leveled up")
```

### 3. Use Appropriate Levels
- Debug: Detailed debugging info
- Info: Normal operations
- Warn: Recoverable issues
- Error: Failures requiring attention

### 4. Structured Errors
```go
log.Error().
    Err(err).
    Str("operation", "create_character").
    Msg("Failed to create character")
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Service Migration**: Replace all fmt.Printf and log.Printf
2. **Add Database Query Logging**: Integrate with database layer
3. **Update All Handlers**: Add error logging before responses
4. **Create Log Aggregation**: Set up ELK or similar
5. **Add Metrics Export**: Export key metrics from logs
6. **Documentation**: Update developer docs with logging guidelines

## Integration with Error Handling

The structured logging system integrates seamlessly with our standardized error handling:
- Error responses automatically log with context
- Request IDs are shared between systems
- Error codes are included in logs
- Stack traces for internal errors

## Conclusion

The structured logging implementation provides a solid foundation for observability and debugging. Combined with our error handling system, it ensures that all operations are traceable and debuggable across the entire application.
